2. **Golden rule** Open _one_ ussie for _one_ bug .
3. [Search for existing reports first.](https://github.com/ninetailsrabbit/zero-point-starter/issues) If you found a similar issue in the tracker - better share your problem in the existing thread.
4. Besides the platform, specify as many specifics as you can _(if relevant)_. CPU/GPU, input methods _(controller, mouse)_ and so on.
